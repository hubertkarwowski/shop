# Hi there âœ‹!
**This project is from a course!** I've changed some styles and have added few sign up buttons(Facebook,Twitter,GitHub)<br>
## Technologies i've used:

  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB" />
</p>

## Why did i build it?
I wanted to learn more about React and see where my skills are lacking.

## Problems i've encountered:
1. I had no idea how to use react-redux, so i had to read docs and then move on with course with some understanding how things connect and work together.
2. I had no idea how firebase works, i had to read docs and play around with code.

## Editor i use:
